# Sign-Up Form Project

### Sign-Up Form Design

This is a basic sign-up form I created as a personal twist for the "Sign-Up Form" project within "The Odin Project".[^1]

I wanted to create my own design rather than implement the design given within the project.

The general idea behind this project is to experiment with the concepts I've learned up until now in the "Intermediate HTML and CSS" course as the original project given doesn't go overboard with the attention to details (it's more focused on practicing the concepts learned rather than taking a deep dive).

You can find the repository for the original project [here](https://github.com/Dur4nt3/form_project).

Both projects are meant to display a developer's ability to implement basic forms.

Although this project and the original aforementioned one *(i.e., the one given by "The Odin Project")* share many similarities, they also differ in many areas.

**Skills demonstrated: Intermediate HTML, Intermediate CSS, Basic JavaScript**

**Webpage responsiveness: THIS WEBPAGE WILL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY ON A MOBILE DEVICE**

### Notes: 

The form sends a POST request and redirects to "https://httpbin.org/post" upon submission.

This is intended as this project doesn't include any back-end functionality, and I decided that instead of simply refreshing the page you should be able to see the request data.

*Sign-Up Inc.* is a mock company name I made up for the sake of this project. 
It doesn't mimic nor does it intend to mimic any real organization.

[^1]: It is important to mention that this project is an addition to the project given by "The Odin Project".
Both projects have their own importance; while the project given by "The Odin Project" encourages implementing a page given a design, my twist encourages creating your own design.
